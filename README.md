Drag and Drop is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice JavaScript. It's a simple exercise of how to drag and drop objects using pure JavaScript.

## See Drag and Drop in action

- Download all files and open the [index.html](https://github.com/valmarath/drag-and-drop/blob/main/index.html) file on your browser.

- To play it, just click on the object you want to drag and leave it in a position as you please. If you set the correct order of the objects (1, 2 and 3), te large rectangle will change it's color to green.

- To understand exactly how the script works and to test some of the features proposed, see the [script.js](https://github.com/valmarath/drag-and-drop/blob/main/script.js).
